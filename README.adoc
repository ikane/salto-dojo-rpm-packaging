This project suggests how to package different Java programs :

 - a classic app hosted in a jar file
 - a daemon app which requires dependencies and some libraries specifics of an architecture.
 - a batch app similare to the classic app but which illustrate the externalization of configurations
 related to an environment
 - a web app hosted by Tomcat requiring the setup of a datasource with externalized configurations 
 related to an environment
 - an automation of the updates of a database by installing an rpm package.

This examples are an illustration on how to package Java apps introduced by the following link:http://slides.com/qvdk/java-rpm-packaging[slides^].
